# Image Classification - Mask Recognition

Classifying images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. In the specific, the solution must discriminate between images depending on the following cases: 
1) All the people in the image are wearing a mask, 
2) No person in the image is wearing a mask, 
3) Someone in the image is not wearing a mask. In the following 3 examples of image from the training belonging to the three cases.

Thus, the classification is performed on 3 different classes. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.
